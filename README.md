#SORTING VISUALIZER
This project provides an interactive way to learn and understand various sorting algorithms through dynamic visualizations. 
By displaying the step-by-step process of each algorithm, it helps users grasp the mechanics behind the sorting techniques and see how they operate in real time.

#Features
-Interactive Interface: Users can generate arrays of different sizes and values to see how different algorithms handle various datasets.
-Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization to follow the sorting process at your own pace.
-Multiple Algorithms: Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
-Real-time Updates: Watch the sorting process in action as elements change positions, highlighting the inner workings of each algorithm.
-Responsive Design: The visualization tool is built to work seamlessly on different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

#Technologies Used
-HTML: Provides the structure for the visualization tool.
-CSS: Styles the interface and elements for a clean and responsive design.
-JavaScript: Powers the array generation, sorting algorithms, and visualization updates.
